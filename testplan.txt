Extra Credit: The undocumented feature that is missing is that when you have a message box open, you cannot open another one. We fixed this error and it can be seen from our third test case.
The error is: ER:EXCRD when you try to open a message box inside a message box that is already opened.


Testplan:


first test: Simple test to make sure everything is stored correctly and works with just 1 client
